Lean for WordPress
==================

Hi :)
This is my second theme for WordPress named Lean: I'm looking forward to a very content-is-king approach for my blog, so I decided to design some kind of one column beautiful theme to satisfy my need - as I am not seeing much of this stuff lookin' around.

This is **not** a parent theme, or a child theme: just upload it, select it and have fun.
If you want to edit my work, report credits please. It's the only price to pay.

Based on _s

On the road to the perfection I was looking for a parent theme or a starter theme to make my work easier, so I chose _s from ThemeShaper as a very promising starter kit. Very well! I believe I'm doing my best thanks to my hands (obviously) and thanks to this wonderful toolbox.
